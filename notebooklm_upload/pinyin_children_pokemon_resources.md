# HanYu PinYin + Kid Teaching + Pokemon (Curated Pack)

This note is designed to be uploaded into NotebookLM as a single “grounding” source.

## 1) HanYu PinYin (Core Reference)

### What to teach (typical order)
- Single vowels: a o e i u u:
- Initials: b p m f d t n l g k h j q x zh ch sh r z c s y w
- Finals: i/u/u: series, compound finals (ai ei ui ao ou iu ie ue er), nasal finals (an en in un u:n ang eng ing ong)
- Tones: 1-4 + neutral tone (light tone)
- Syllable spelling rules (j/q/x + u: written as "u"; y/w as spelling helpers, etc.)

### Common kid difficulties (and what works)
- Tone confusion (especially 2 vs 3): use gesture + visual tone marks + short minimal pairs.
- i/u/u: mouth shape confusion: mirror practice + exaggerated mouth posture.
- z/zh, c/ch, s/sh: tongue position cues + “front/back” mouth diagrams.
- Blending: avoid over-fragmenting; do more guided blending (initial+final) with fast, fun repetitions.

## 2) Kid-Friendly Teaching (Classroom + Home)

### Multi-sensory “4-channel” routine (5-10 minutes)
1. Listen: teacher model + audio (slow -> normal)
2. See: big mouth-shape picture + tone contour line
3. Move: hand signs for tones; tap beats for syllables
4. Build: letter tiles / cards; quickly blend into syllables

### Micro-games (no prep / low prep)
- Tone Train: kids move a finger along a 4-line track (flat / rising / dipping / falling).
- Mouth Mirror: partner checks mouth shape for i/u/u:.
- Syllable Bingo: teacher calls "ma2" / "ma3"; kids cover the exact pinyin.
- Sound Hunt: find classroom objects whose first syllable matches target initial/final.

### Output tasks (to prevent “only can read, can’t use”)
- 10-second speaking: each kid says 2 target syllables in a short phrase.
- Dictation-lite: teacher says syllable -> kid writes pinyin + tone mark.

## 3) Pokemon-Themed Pinyin Activities

Goal: borrow Pokemon familiarity to increase attention and repetition without changing the phonics goals.

### A) “Pokemon Name = Pinyin Target”

Use well-known Chinese Pokemon names as syllable practice anchors.

| Pokemon (CN) | Pinyin | What to practice |
|---|---|---|
| 皮卡丘 | pi2 ka3 qiu1 | tones + qi/qiu |
| 小火龙 | xiao3 huo3 long2 | x- initial, -iao, -uo, -ong |
| 杰尼龟 | jie2 ni2 gui1 | j- initial, -ie, -ui |
| 妙蛙种子 | miao4 wa1 zhong3 zi3 | -iao, w-, zh-, -ong, tones |

Tip: You do NOT need to cover “all Pokemon”. Pick 4-12 names that match the week’s phonics targets.

### B) Flashcards (printable plan)

Each card:
- Front: Pokemon image + Chinese name
- Back: Pinyin with tone marks + 1 mouth-shape hint + 1 blending hint

Card drill:
1) Read pinyin -> 2) Say it with correct tone -> 3) Clap syllables -> 4) Quick sentence ("wo3 xi3 huan1 ...")

### C) “Gym Badge” mastery rubric

Give a small badge when a kid can:
- recognize the syllable (seen)
- pronounce with correct mouth shape (spoken)
- mark the tone (tone)
- write pinyin legibly (written)
